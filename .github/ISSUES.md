If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy: 

1. It must be one of:
   - Bug
   - Feature Request
   - Performance Issue
   - Build/Documentation issue
2. The issue being opened must pertain to the repository that it is being opened in
3. The appropriate issue template needs to be filled out

**Why this policy exists:** It helps us focus on the contributions that benefits the whole community. Individual support should be sought on channels like our [mailing list] or [slack]
